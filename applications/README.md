# Applications

⚠️ This folder is not cleaned yet.

Details about each individual application below. NOTE: results may not match perfectly to the paper but the top hypotheses and scores should be similar. 

## Datasets

We utilize the following datasets in our applications:
- [LaMeM](http://memorability.csail.mit.edu/explore.html)
- [ImageNetV2](https://github.com/modestyachts/ImageNetV2)
- [PartiPrompts](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nateraw/parti-prompts)
- [DiffusionDB](https://poloclub.github.io/diffusiondb/) 
    - we use a random subset of the DiffusionDB prompts which are located in [diffusionDB.csv](Diffusion/diffusionDB.csv)

Note that we generate the images using the Parti and DiffusionDB prompts. These images can be generated by running [generate_images](Diffusion/generate_images.py).

To prepare the data CSV for each application: (1) download the dataset (2) replace the path in [data_paths.py](data_paths.py) (3) run the `generate_csv.py` file in the subfolder of each application.
